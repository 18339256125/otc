# FAQ
  - How clone this repository?
  > git clone https://github.com/0x000cb/otc.git && git submodule update --init --recursive
  -----
 - Everything worked out, but when i inject onetap, menu it does not render.
 > Enable multi-threaded rendering (in csgo) and then inject OTC. (If everything still does not work before, add a flag to disable d3x9 in the CS: GO startup parameters)
  ------
  - When you already fix what I need so much ??? I canâ€™t play without it !!! (There should be a function name without which you cannot play)
